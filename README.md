## MS-SSIM metric results correction
![ms_ssim_correction](MSSSIM_values.png)


We found an error in our MS-SSIM measurement process and confirmed that incorrect values were reported in the original paper. The table above presents the corrected performance results after re-evaluating the MS-SSIM scores accurately.
As shown in the table of the updated results, our model achieves still outperforms DCVC-DC model. Furthermore, our model demonstrates higher performance on the MCL-JCV dataset, indicating better results across a various test datasets than initially reported in the paper.
